Project Title: "Real-Time Data Pipeline for Predicting Supply Chain Disruptions"
Introduction
Supply chain disruptions can lead to significant financial losses and inefficiencies for businesses. This project aims to develop a real-time data engineering pipeline that integrates machine learning to predict supply chain disruptions by analyzing live data streams from multiple sources, such as weather data, social media, IoT sensor data, and news articles. The system will deliver actionable insights through a web-based dashboard, enabling proactive decision-making.

High-Level Architecture
The project involves the following components:

Data Ingestion
Collects data from multiple real-time and batch sources.
Stream Processing
Processes and aggregates the data using Kafka and Spark.
Machine Learning
Implements predictive models to identify potential disruptions.
Data Storage
Uses optimized storage solutions for structured and unstructured data.
Visualization
Provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring and insights.
Deployment and Scalability
Deploys the system on AWS with container orchestration for scalability.
Monitoring and Alerting
Includes monitoring and automated alerting for system health.
Key Features
1. Data Ingestion
Sources:

Weather Data: Integrate OpenWeatherMap API to track adverse weather conditions.
Social Media: Use Twitter API for sentiment analysis of supply chain-related keywords.
News Data: Use Google News API to identify geopolitical events or strikes.
IoT Data: Simulate IoT sensors for GPS tracking, temperature, and humidity data from vehicles or warehouses.
Technologies:

Apache Kafka for event-driven ingestion.
Python scripts for API integration and data scraping.
2. Stream Processing
Pipeline:

Apache Kafka handles message queues.
Apache Spark processes and aggregates incoming data streams.
Example Tasks:

Analyze weather data to identify hazardous routes.
Perform sentiment analysis on social media posts to detect potential supply chain risks.
Correlate news data with IoT device statuses to predict delays.
3. Machine Learning
Model Development:

Historical Data: Train models on historical datasets of disruptions (e.g., weather events, transportation delays).
Features:
Weather patterns (e.g., storms, snowfall).
Social media sentiment scores.
GPS-based movement patterns of vehicles.
News event categorization (e.g., strikes, political unrest).
Models:

Random Forest for feature importance and prediction.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series predictions.
Integration:

Deploy models using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Retrain models periodically using updated data streams.
4. Data Storage
Technologies:

PostgreSQL for structured data (e.g., weather, news, and predictions).
Redis for caching high-priority, frequently accessed data.
AWS S3 for storing raw and preprocessed datasets.
Optimization:

Implement query optimization techniques for high-performance data retrieval.
Use indexing and partitioning for large tables in PostgreSQL.
5. Visualization Dashboard
Frontend:

React: Build an interactive dashboard with real-time graphs, alerts, and KPIs.
Visualization Libraries: Use D3.js or Chart.js for dynamic charts.
Backend:

FastAPI: Serve predictions and processed data to the frontend.
WebSocket: Implement real-time updates on the dashboard.
Features:

Predictive insights displayed as alerts.
Route recommendations based on disruption forecasts.
Historical data visualization for trends and patterns.
6. Deployment and Scalability
Infrastructure:

AWS ECS/Fargate: Deploy microservices for ingestion, processing, and ML models.
AWS Lambda: Handle lightweight tasks like API calls and preprocessing.
AWS S3: Store data backups and logs.
Containerization:

Use Docker to containerize individual services.
Use Kubernetes for orchestration and auto-scaling.
Infrastructure as Code:

Use Terraform for automating AWS infrastructure setup.
7. Monitoring and Alerting
Technologies:

Datadog for real-time monitoring of system performance.
PagerDuty for sending alerts on failures or high latency.
Features:

Monitor Kafka queues, Spark jobs, and API latencies.
Alert when data processing slows or predictions exceed thresholds.
Detailed Implementation Steps
Step 1: Setup Data Ingestion
Write Python scripts to fetch data from OpenWeather, Reddit, Google News APIs.
Simulate IoT data streams using Python scripts and MQTT protocol.
Send collected data to Kafka topics.
Step 2: Stream Processing
Set up Kafka brokers and topics for different data types (e.g., weather, social media).
Write Spark jobs to consume, clean, and aggregate data.
Store processed data in PostgreSQL and Redis.
Step 3: Machine Learning
Collect historical data for training ML models.
Perform feature engineering (e.g., converting text into sentiment scores, encoding categorical data).
Train models and evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE or F1-score.
Save the trained model and deploy it using FastAPI.
Step 4: Backend Development
Build a FastAPI backend with endpoints for:
Fetching processed data.
Serving ML predictions.
Real-time updates to the frontend using WebSocket.
Step 5: Frontend Development
Build a React dashboard with:
Maps showing real-time vehicle routes and disruptions.
Alert panels for high-risk routes.
Historical graphs for disruption trends.
Step 6: Deployment
Write Dockerfiles for each service (e.g., Kafka, Spark, FastAPI).
Deploy services on AWS ECS using Fargate.
Use Terraform to provision AWS resources.
Step 7: Monitoring
Integrate Datadog for monitoring Kafka, Spark, and backend services.
Set up PagerDuty for alerting system failures.
